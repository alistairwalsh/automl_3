Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broader concept that refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI, 
         focused on training algorithms to 
         learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. In essence, machine learning is a key technology within the field of artificial intelligence.
         Hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing the configuration settings, known as hyperparameters, of a machine learning model to achieve better performance. These hyperparameters are not learned from the 
         data but are set prior to the training process. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the combination that results in the most effective and accurate model for a given task or dataset.

         Neural networks typically require larger amounts of data compared to classical machine learning models. This is because neural networks, especially deep learning models, have a high number of 
         parameters that need to be optimized, and a large dataset helps prevent overfitting and allows the model to generalize well to unseen data.

Classical machine learning models, such as decision trees or linear regression, may perform reasonably well with smaller datasets, as they have fewer parameters and dependencies to learn.

In summary, neural networks often benefit from big datasets to effectively learn complex patterns and relationships, while some classical machine learning models can perform adequately with smaller datasets.
