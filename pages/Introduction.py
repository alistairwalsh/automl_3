Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broader concept that refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI, 
         focused on training algorithms to 
         learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. In essence, machine learning is a key technology within the field of artificial intelligence.
